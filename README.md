# My modified dwm

![DEMO](assets_for_github/demo1.png)

This is my **HEAVILY MODIFIED** version of dwm. It is based on the original [dwm-titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dwm-titus) dwm window manager just fine tuned for my preferances.

## Installation

1. Assuming you have a base TTY set up with internet and other stuff ( I would recommend christitus arch server setup for that )
2. After a fresh login write these commands:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WattoX00/arch-setup.git

    cd /arch-setup

    chmod +x dwm-wattox.sh

    bash dwm-wattox.sh
    ```
3. This will run the isntallation script and will ask for sudo permission a few times

See here what it will install: [ArchSetup](https://github.com/WattoX00/arch-setup)
