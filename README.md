# My modified dwm

This is my **HEAVILY MODIFIED** version of dwm. It is based on the original [dwm-titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dwm-titus) dwm window manager just fine tuned for my preferances.

## Installation

1. Launch Linutil Project with the command:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL christitus.com/linux | sh
    ```

2. Get arch linux server
3. After a reboot write these commands:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WattoX00/arch-setup.git

    cd /arch-setup

    chmod +x dwm-wattox.sh

    bash dwm-wattox.sh
    ```
